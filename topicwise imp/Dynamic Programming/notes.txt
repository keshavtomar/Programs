Dynamic programmig use recursion to reach to the solution but just with a advance approach of saving 
the answers to reduce time of solving

Consider writing the recursive fibonacci code to get the 5th fibonacci number, for 5th fibonacci
we have to add 3rd and 4th, we calculated 3rd, to find 4th we have have to add 3rd and 2nd, what if
when we calculated 3rd we would have saved the answer so that when we have to calculate 3rd and 2nd for 4th, 
we get the 3rd from the saved answer

The technique is to maintain a 2d table, intially initialise it with -1, as we have to return an
answer save that in table and then return it, before calling recursion to get an answer check the 
table, if we have already the answer return from there. Create this matrix globally
To set the whole matrix -1 value, use ' memset(t,-1,sizeof(t)); '

This approach is very helpful to reduce the time complexity of  questions like fibonacci and knapsack

HOW TO CHECK IF A QUESTION INVOLVES DP?
sol ->  1. Questions involving DP will have a choice at every step(like should we include this or not)
        2. We will have to calculate the optimal answer(demanding max, min values);



->
   There are two approaches to solve dp one is to use recursion + memoization and the other is to 
   directly use dp table, first one is more easy and understandable

   In direct dp table, we avoid our recursive calls, in rare cases our recursive call stack fills 
   out completely so to avoid the error we use dp table also known as top down approach
